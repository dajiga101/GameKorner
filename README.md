# GameKorner
  GameKorner is an Mock-Up of a gamestore where customers have more flexibilty as to how they want to relate with the ever changing gaming ecosystem



  Customers are allowed to swap physical Games for online games using the SWAP feature if both games reach the expected threshold.



  This would allow users who have gaming console that operate digitally to still have a use for their physical games and vice versa.
